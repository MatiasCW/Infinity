 Website with many calculators

This website has more than 10 calculators organized in subjects such as, math, science, finance, and other.


 This website was put together with Bootstrap 5, very little CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.

 # HOW IT WORKS
 Numbers are put into a JavaScript form that takes them into variables to calculate the outcome depending on the calculator using the data given by the user. A lot of these calculators are inspired by formulas I have used before, or school work that I have done in the past. The answer pops up into an alert box on the top of the screen, this will probably be changed so that you can see the answer on the screen because alert boxes aren't that clean. Many calculators have dropdown links to calculate different variables of that equation depending on the given and the variable you need to find.
